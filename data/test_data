This is a film made for children, not adults. Ninja-Turtles kind of movie. Stupid jokes, no plot, non-sense whatsoever. At least, when I was a child, films used to make if only a bit of sense; not any more for milennials, it seems. New world, new styles, very little brain. Pity...
I wish I could have my 2.5 hours back. The film was over-long and packed with way too much violence for what it delivered as entertainment. It also spent too much time focusing on the villain and his rationalizations for genocide. I found myself wondering if such indulgences would seem inappropriate to dwell on for a real mass murderer like Rudolf Hoess, why is it appropriate dramatically for Thanos? Answer: It's not. This film was easily the worst Marvel film I've seen.
The movie is glorious and on a more shallow note, I covet Jessica Chastain's hair and wardrobe in this:
Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. 
my exact feelings on this film. "Static" (2012) is a total bore. Extremely predictable, terrible pacing, cop-out ending. Honestly no redeeming value here. It's a total ripoff of "The Sixth Sense." Bleh.
